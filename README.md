This repository contains the codebase for Jarvis, a robot built for the RoboCup Junior Rescue Maze competition. Jarvis uses advanced algorithms for image detection, path planning, and obstacle avoidance to autonomously navigate mazes and perform rescue tasks. It won first place in Egypt and competed internationally in Eindhoven, Netherlands.
